## Assignment
This project will demonstrate the ability to gather data, manipulate it, and organize it in into a database. This project does **not** include any data analysis. The purpose of this project is to create a well ordered, useful database that could be utilized by an organization. Databases resulting from ETL are often the starting point for an organization's data analysis.
